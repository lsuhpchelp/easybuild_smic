On Philip3: The default toolchain is INTEL-15.0.3. I haven't created a MPI tool chain yet.

These are the list of packages for which we have config files already:

atlas
*blast
boost
*bowtie
*bowtie2
cmake
fftw
flex
gcc
GCC
gromacs
gsl
hdf5
hmmer
hwloc
hypre
intel
INTEL
INTEL-140-MPICH
INTEL-140-MVAPICH2
INTEL-140-OPENMPI
INTEL-150-MPICH
lapack
libreadline
mercurial
metis
*mothur
mpich
*mrbayes
*mummer
mumps
mvapich2
ncurses
netcdf
netcdf_fortran
nwchem
openblas
openfoam
openmpi
paraview
parmetis
*perl
petsc
python
qt
*r
*samtools
scalapack
scotch
szip
*tophat
valgrind

I tried to installe some of them - most were successful, with some failure, most significantly Perl and R. I marked the ones I think should have priority with "*" - it either fails or has newer version that needs to be added.

Packages to add to Easybuild:

I think that priority should be given to packages that are currently present on Philip so that the transition to the new stack would be smoother. 

Here are the candidates:

abyss
amos
beast
cufflinks
expat
fastx_toolkit
garli
idba
*ima2
lastz
mafft
mauve
mira
muscle
oases
paup
rum
*scythe
*sickle
soapdenovo
soapdenovo-trans
velvet
vmatch

Some of them are not in our baseline pool of bioinformatic tools, which are marked with "*".
